The purpose of this project is to create a system that generates personalized playlists 
by analyzing user prompts and leveraging Spotify's audio features. 
The project aims to enhance the user experience by recommending music that aligns with 
specific emotions, activities, or scenarios (e.g., "workout," "relax," "sad").

How to set up and run:
1.) Install software
    - Node.js (v14 or later): For running the backend server.
    - Python 3 (v3.8 or later): To execute the recommendationgetter.py script.
    - pip: For managing Python packages.

2.) Python packages, run these commands(make sure pip is installed):
    - "npm install"
    - Spotipy: command is "pip install spotipy" once pip is installed
    - "pip install flask"
    - "pip install requests"

3.) ensure every file is properly downloaded and in the right folder

4.) Run server
    - type "node node.mjs" once everything is set up to start the back end server

5.) Open live server and test our software! (make sure the extension for live server is installed for vscode)

easily modify certain features:
1.) adjust amount of generated songs, within recommendationgetter...
    - change x to any number (defualt 30)"limit_per_genre = x  # Number of tracks per genre to fetch"
    -
